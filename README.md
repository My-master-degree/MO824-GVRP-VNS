# VNS_GVRP

This is the source code from one of the [MO824](https://www.dac.unicamp.br/portal/caderno-de-horarios/2019/1/S/P/IC/MO824) course activities. 
This repository contains an implementation of a Java 1.8 code for the [VNS (Variable Neighborhood Search)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0305-0548(97)00031-2) for the [GVRP (Gree-Vehicle Routing Problem)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2011.08.001).
The project file structure works as follows:

* CVRP Instances: Contains some CVRP (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem) instances from Augerat et al;
* instances: Contains the GVRP instances proposed by [Erdogan and Miller-Hooks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2011.08.001);
* results: Contains the experiments results for the execution of the VNS and the exact model (on [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/));
* src: Source code.
